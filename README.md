# SCT_CS_1
A simple Python script to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Built as part of an internship task at Skillcraft Technology.

# 🔐 Caesar Cipher Encryption-Decryption Tool

This is a simple Python program that allows users to *encrypt and decrypt messages* using the *Caesar Cipher algorithm. Developed as my **first task during the internship at Skillcraft Technology*, this project demonstrates the use of string manipulation and basic cryptographic logic.

## 💡 Features

- Encrypts text using a Caesar cipher with a user-defined shift.
- Decrypts text using the same shift value.
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Menu-driven terminal interface for easy interaction.

## 📌 How it Works

- Each letter in the input message is shifted by a number (shift key) within the alphabet.
- Non-alphabetic characters are left unchanged.
- Decryption uses the negative shift of the same value.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3
